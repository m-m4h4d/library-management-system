- A MySQL database.

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash

    cd library-management-system
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure the database and `.env` file:

    - Run the following SQL script to set up the database:

      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE library_management;
      USE library_management;

      CREATE TABLE books (
          id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
          title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
          author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
          genre VARCHAR(100),
          year INT,
          available BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
          created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
      );

      CREATE TABLE users (
          id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
          name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
          email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
          password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
          role ENUM('admin', 'member') DEFAULT 'member'
      );

      CREATE TABLE transactions (
          id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
          book_id INT NOT NULL,
          user_id INT NOT NULL,
          borrow_date DATE NOT NULL,
          return_date DATE,
          status ENUM('borrowed', 'returned') DEFAULT 'borrowed',
          FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id),
          FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
      );
      ```

    - Create `.env` with below data:

      ```env
      DB_HOST=
      DB_USER=
      DB_PASSWORD=
      DB_NAME=
      DB_PORT=
      ```

4. Start the server:
